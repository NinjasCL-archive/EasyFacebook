Purpose
--------------

FacebookHelper is aimed for iOS developers who do most of the Facebook related stuff on their servers and only really need to get the Facebook token of a user in their apps. This pod gives these developers the ability to do everything they may need with just 3 simple methods, and saves them any headache they may normally face such as having to juggle between Social Framework and Facebook's iOS SDK. It also does really cool stuff such as knowing what permissions it previously asked for from the user, and if your new permission request doesn't introduce anything that hasn't been asked for before, it just gives you the saved token (which is, of course, checked for validity).
